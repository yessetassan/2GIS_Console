# 2GIS Advanced Algorithm Project

# About: 
Letâ€™s assume that some person wants to get from KBTU to SDU by wasting the minimum amount of time. Construct a graph for this problem. Vertices will be specific locations (e.g. airport, stops, malls, etc.). Edge consists of 3 values (distance in km between vertices, ratio of congestion based on datetime, velocity based on transport).
Construct an algorithm which returns a sequence of vertices to visit for each transport and datetime so that this person will get to her location. Datetime is from 9 AM to 8:59 AM. 10 types of traffic congestions. 4 types of transport (car, bus, metro, walk).
